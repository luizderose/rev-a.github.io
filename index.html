      <h2>Re-Emergence of Vector Architectures</h2>

      <p><button type="button" href="https://cluster17.github.io/"
      class="btn btn-lg btn-primary">IEEE Cluster 2017</button></p>
    </div>

    <p>The commoditization of high performance computing to a
    broader range of applications coupled with the reduction in
    performance improvement from traditional scaling technologies
    has led to a broad interest in a number of new compute
    acceleration technologies from GPGPUs to CGRAs and FPGAs.
    Meanwhile, SIMD widths have been widening to try to keep up
    with computational demand and general purpose architectures
    have started incorporating features from the vector
    architectures that used to dominate high performance computing.
    From IBM's Vector Media eXtension (VMX) to
    NEC's SX architecture to
    Intel's Advanced Vector eXtension (AVX) to
    ARM's recently announced Scalable Vector
    Extension (SVE) -- all of the major general purpose
    architectures seem to have embraced a return to vector based
    functionality.</p>

    <p>Supporting these hardware developments there are a number of
    features being proposed for incorporation into modern
    programming models and languages in order to support the vector
    additions as well as restructuring memory access in order to
    feed the computational pipelines. Meanwhile application
    developers have been hard at work trying to refactor code to
    take advantage of wider vector units and more complicated
    memory hierarchies. Tools and techniques for developing for
    these new vector architectures are still evolving, particularly
    on emerging languages and runtimes.</p>

<p>The REV-A 2017 workshop will be a full-day meeting to be held at the IEEE Cluster 2017, in Honolulu, Hawaii, focusing on all aspects of vector architectures, programming models, programming frameworks, and applications.   Topics of interest, of both theoretical and practical significance, include but are not limited to the following topics:</p> 

    <ul>
      <li>Programming framework</li>

      <li>Programming model and language explorations</li>

      <li>Compilation and optimization including:</li>

      <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
          <li>algorithmic improvements</li>

          <li>code optimization</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Performance Analysis and Debugging Tools</li>

      <li>Performance Metrics and Evaluations</li>

      <li>Libraries and run-time systems</li>

      <li>Design, generation, verification and validation of
      representative applications</li>

      <li>Case-studies of representative applications</li>

      <li>Innovative applications for vector architectures</li>

      <li>Hardware studies and micro-architectural implementation
      tradeoffs</li>
    </ul>

      <h1>Submission Details</h1>
    </div>


    <p>The REV-A workshop proceedings will be published along with the IEEE Cluster Digital Library. Submitted manuscripts should follow the IEEE Xplore format for publication: not exceed 10 single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages, including figures, tables, and references. Manuscripts must be submitted electronically in PDF format. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the workshop attendees. Submitted papers may not have appeared in or be under consideration for another workshop, conference, or journal. Accepted papers will have a page limit of 8 pages, and authors can purchase an additional 2 pages, for a total of 10 pages maximum.</p>
